# Jeff Chambers - DT Test Project
Hi Dave & Team!

I've gone through and done the initial coding for the demo page you provided. This is roughly 7 hours of work, including the production work exporting the assets from the PSD, researching tools for functionality, etc.

Let me know if you would like me to map out how I would implement Responsive CSS, functionality for items like the Menu, Love What You Do carousel, Quiz section, etc.

Thanks!
